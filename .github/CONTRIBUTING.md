# Contributing Guide

First of all, thank you for your interest in the project! üíö

You are welcome to contribute by:

* opening an issue to report bugs or request features;
* creating a pull request to fix a bug or implement a new feature;
* participating in discussions on the existing issues and PRs.

Whether you're opening an issue or creating a pull request, make sure to apply
our forms and templates as well as to follow the instructions and checklists
you'll find therein.

> If you are unfamiliar with contributing to open-source projects, consider
> taking a look at the official [GitHub docs][github-docs] or other related
> guides and assets, e.g., [First Contribution][first-contribution].

## Issues

There are several types of issues one can [open][open-issue] to contribute to
the project:

* üêõ [Bug report][open-bug-report]
* ‚ú® [Feature request][open-feature-request]
* üçª [Discussions][open-discussion]

An issue of each type can be created using a specific form. Irrespective of the
issue type, contributors are requested to confirm that they are familiar with
this guide and the project's [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct], as well as
that the issue they open is not a duplicate.

## Pull Requests

If you're looking to make small tweaks, especially in the docs or similar, feel
free to jump straight to creating a pull request. But if it's something more
substantial, like reporting a bug or suggesting a new feature, it's better to
start off by opening an issue. This gives everyone in the community a chance to
chime in and make sure we're all on the same page. Once there's a general
agreement, you can go ahead and submit your pull request.

When creating each pull request, it is crucial to adhere to the provided
instructions:

01. [Fork][fork] the repo and clone it to your machine.
02. Go to the project's root directory to create the virtual environment and
    activate it:

    ```console
    $ python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    > In order to precisely reproduce the development environment, it is
    > recommended to use the Python version specified in
    > [`.python-version`][python-version]. The version given therein is checked
    > out by default in all the CI environments.

03. Install the package in editable (development) mode, along with all the
    optional dependencies:

    ```console
    $ pip install -e ".[dev,docs,lint,test]"
    ```

04. Install [Pre-commit][pre-commit] hooks:

    ```console
    $ pre-commit install
    ```

05. Run linters and tests using [Nox][nox]:

    ```console
    $ nox
    ```

    This will check your fork's setup, the code quality with linters, run the
    existing tests in different Python environments, and measure the coverage.

    > Note that you should have all the versions of Python installed on your
    > machine. Consider using [`pyenv`][pyenv] to work with multiple Python
    > interpreters.

    If you want to be more specific, you can only run the linting or testing
    suites via the respective Nox sessions. All the available sessions can be
    listed using the command:

    ```console
    $ nox -l
    ```

    For more details, see [`noxfile.py`][noxfile] and [Nox docs][nox-docs].
    Besides, note that all the linters and testing tools are installed in the
    virtual environment anyway. Therefore, feel absolutely free to use them
    independently of Nox as well.

06. Check out a new feature branch and introduce changes.

    > All the changes affecting the codebase must be accompanied by relevant
    > unit tests and documentation updates. We always attempt to maintain 100%
    > test coverage, and we require that from all pull requests as well. Those
    > with tests missing (if they are needed, of course) have exactly zero
    > chance of being merged!

07. Run Nox.

    If all the Nox sessions are successful and the changes are covered by tests,
    commit your changes and push them to remote.

    > Keep in mind that when you create a pull request, the CI will run all the
    > Nox sessions anyway. Nevertheless, it is still strongly recommended to
    > test everything locally before pushing to remote and opening a pull
    > request.

08. [Create a pull request][create-pull-request] from the feature branch of your
    fork to the `main` branch of the original repository.

    > Don't forget to mark the pull request with an appropriate Gitmoji! üòú

That's it! üéâ

As soon as your pull request passes all CI checks, it will be reviewed by the
project's maintainers as soon as possible. üßê
