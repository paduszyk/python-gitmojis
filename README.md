## Summary

This package provides a few simple utilities to apply the official
[Gitmoji Guide][gitmoji-website] in Python libraries. It may potentially serve
as a helper in projects related to version control systems, versioning, and
automatic changelog generation. Applications in automation tools for validating
commit and pull request messages seem feasible as well.

## Credits

The idea of Gitmoji was originally proposed, developed, and maintained by
Carlos Cuesta ([@carloscuesta][github-carlosquesta]). For more information, see
the official [repository][gitmoji-repository] and [website][gitmoji-website] of
the project.
